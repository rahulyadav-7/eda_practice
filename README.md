# Steps involved in EDA


## Detailed Steps for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Import Required Libraries
Identify Required Libraries: Determine which libraries are necessary for your analysis (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Install Libraries: Ensure all libraries are installed (if not already).
Import Libraries: Import the libraries into your Python environment.
2. Load the Dataset
Select Data Source: Choose the file path or URL of the dataset.
Load Data: Use appropriate functions to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
Check Data Format: Verify that the data is in the correct format (e.g., DataFrame).
3. View the Data
Display Initial Rows: Use commands to view the first few rows of the dataset.
Check Data Types: Examine the data types of each column.
Get Summary Information: Retrieve information on non-null counts and data types.
Generate Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
Visualize Data Samples: Optionally, visualize a few samples from the dataset.
4. Check for Duplicates
Identify Duplicates: Use functions to find duplicate rows in the dataset.
Count Duplicates: Count the total number of duplicate entries.
Decide on Action: Determine whether to remove duplicates or keep them based on your analysis goals.
Remove Duplicates: If necessary, remove duplicate entries from the DataFrame.
5. Handle Missing Values
Check for Missing Values: Use functions to identify missing values in each column.
Visualize Missing Values: Optionally, create a heatmap or other visualizations to show missing data patterns.
Decide on Strategy: Choose how to handle missing values:
Drop Missing Values: Remove rows or columns with missing values.
Fill Missing Values: Impute missing values using techniques like mean, median, mode, or forward/backward fill.
Implement Chosen Strategy: Apply the chosen method to handle missing values.
6. Univariate Analysis
Analyze Numerical Variables:
Histograms: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
Box Plots: Generate box plots to identify outliers and visualize the spread of numerical data.
Summary Statistics: Review descriptive statistics for numerical variables.
Analyze Categorical Variables:
Frequency Counts: Count occurrences of each category in categorical variables.
Bar Plots: Create bar plots to visualize the frequency distribution of categorical variables.
Pie Charts: Optionally, use pie charts to show proportions of categories.
7. Bivariate Analysis
Analyze Relationships Between Numerical Variables:
Scatter Plots: Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between pairs of numerical variables.
Correlation Coefficient: Calculate and interpret correlation coefficients (Pearson/Spearman) between numerical variables.
Analyze Relationships Between Categorical and Numerical Variables:
Box Plots: Use box plots to compare distributions of numerical variables across categories.
Violin Plots: Optionally, create violin plots for a more detailed distribution comparison.
Analyze Relationships Between Categorical Variables:
Contingency Tables: Create cross-tabulations to examine the relationship between two categorical variables.
Grouped Bar Plots: Use grouped bar plots to visualize counts of categories across another categorical variable.
8. Multivariate Analysis
Pair Plots: Create pair plots to visualize relationships among multiple numerical variables.
Correlation Matrix: Generate a correlation matrix to assess relationships between all numerical variables.
Heatmaps: Visualize the correlation matrix using heatmaps for better interpretation.
Group Analysis: Analyze how multiple variables interact with each other and their effect on a target variable.
9. Summary of Findings
Document Observations: Write down key insights and observations from your analyses.
Identify Patterns and Trends: Highlight any significant patterns, correlations, or anomalies discovered.
Prepare Recommendations: Based on findings, prepare recommendations for further analysis or modeling.
Visualize Key Insights: Optionally, create summary visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
10. Optional: Automated EDA Tools
Research Automated Tools: Identify tools like ydata-profiling or sweetviz that can automate EDA.
Install the Tool: Ensure the tool is installed in your environment.
Generate EDA Report: Use the tool to create a comprehensive report that includes visualizations and summary statistics.
Review the Report: Analyze the automated report for additional insights or confirmation of findings.
This granular breakdown provides a comprehensive view of each step in the EDA process, ensuring that you cover all essential aspects of data exploration and analysis.
